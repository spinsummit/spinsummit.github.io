The 4th Spin Summit workshop is set to take place in **Guiyang, Guizhou Province, China**, from **August 4 to August 9, 2025**. 

This workshop will delve into both the fundamental and applied dimensions of spintronics, facilitating meaningful and beneficial interactions among participants. Attendees will have the opportunity to engage in a variety of discussions, encompassing both structured formats and informal exchanges, thereby fostering a collaborative atmosphere for knowledge sharing. 

Previous iterations of the Spin Summit workshop have taken place in Dujiangyan, Sichuang 四川都江堰 ([2023](../index_2023.html)), Xingyi, Guizhou Province 贵州兴义 ([2018](../2018/index.html)), and Jinggangshan, Jiangxi Province 江西井冈山 ([2017](../2017/index.html)).
